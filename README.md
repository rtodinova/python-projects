This repository contains 10 Python projects: web applications, desktop applications, data analyse and other.

Here is a description of the projects included:

1. Interactive Dictionary - smart English dictionary, which uses json in order to display definitions of requested words. The dictionary uses difflib if there is a misspell in the user input and suggests similar word.
2. Webmaps with Python and Folium - web map implemented with Folium, that contains markers for all volcanoes in the world and their evaluation (using a csv file from www.arcgis.com) and different colors depending on the population of the country.
